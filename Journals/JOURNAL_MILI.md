### Scrum meeting : 1

  

**Team Member Name**

  

Mili

  

**What I did**

  

-> Researching design patterns in game development

  

-> Brainstorming ideas for the game

  

-> Exploring the design pattern implementation in the project (still

pending)

  

-> Making the task sheet skeleton

  
  

**What I plan to do next**

  

-> UI Mockup brainstorming and making the UI Mockups

  

-> Extracting questions and the images from the arraylist and displaying

it on the frame

  
  

**What blockers I have**

  

-> None
**XP Value**
Simplicity:
As the XP value simplicity states, we decided the scope of the project. I suggested that we make list of basic features of the game and find a suitable platform to build it.

### Scrum meeting : 2

  

**Team Member Name**

  

Mili

  

**What I did**

  

-> Made two UI Mockups for the game

  

-> Completed extraction of questions and the images from the arraylist

and displaying it on the frame

  
  

**What I plan to do next**

  

-> Cropping images for displaying it as hints for the questions

-> Implementing observer design pattern for score calculation and

displaying it simultaneously on each page as the game progresses

  

-> Implementing template design pattern to abstract the loading of data

based on difficulty level

  
  

**What blockers I have**

  

-> None

**XP Value**
Simplicity:
After exploring the various gaming platforms we decided to go with the Java Swing Applet as it was easier to learn for development and it was perfect for the UI requirement of our game. Thus, we maintained the simplicity value by choosing a simple yet efficient platform to start with the development. Also I suggested that we make the basic end to end flow of the game without the complexities as they can be done later in keeping in mind the  principle ''Do the simplest thing that could possibly work''.

### Scrum meeting : 3

  

**Team Member Name**

  

Mili

  

**What I did**

  

-> Implemented the template design pattern

  

-> Implemented the observer design pattern (still pending)

  
  

**What I plan to do next**

  

-> Complete the pending implementation of observer design pattern and

some modifications to it.

  

-> Making UML diagram for the project ï¿½ Activity diagram

  

-> Making one system sequence diagram based on the feature stories and

Use Case specifications

  

**What blockers I have**

  

-> None

  **XP Value**
Simplicity:
After making the UI and basic flow it was time to implement the design patterns.I suggested that we first make list of all design patterns that can be implemented in the game and then strike out those patterns which make a simple task complicated using the pattern ,for e.g we decided not to implement interpreter for reading the JSON, and decided not to implement the composite pattern for screen display as we were using the applet structure and hence the composite pattern didn't fit there elegantly. Also we decide to make the simplest possible end to end flow with using the assigned patterns and make it work.

### Scrum meeting : 4

  

**Team Member Name**

  

Mili

  

**What I did**

  

-> Complete implementation of design pattern with proper testing from my

side

  

-> Made the activity diagram to depict the flow of the project

-> Made one system sequence diagram

  

-> Wrote the user story

  
  
  

**What I plan to do next**

  
  

**What blockers I have**

  

-> None

  **XP Value**
Simplicity:
After Implementing the patterns and solving the problems as and when they came while adding all the functionalities we were able to maintain this value that we kept in mind that we can add the complexities at the later state as we all have that capability.We made something that we are proud of and while keeping this value with us for the entire project duration.
